For a given dataset, - Get, or make, the data set to examine

- Find the percent of numbers that start with 1...
... - Then the percent of numbers that start with 2...
.... - and so forth, until you have all 9 percentages

- See if the percentages are close (or match) Benford's law.... if not, then there is something fishy here
